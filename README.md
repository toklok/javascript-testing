# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


## This is the jasmine tests for the RSS feeds application, this is how you will ensure it runs properly.

You will download the assets and run index.html, there you will see everything passes and all the current tests are completed.


## What did I learn from this project?

I dived into Test Driven Development, using async jasmine functions to ensure proper operation and testing the DOM to ensure proper functionality.
